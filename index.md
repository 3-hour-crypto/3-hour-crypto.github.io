# Introduction

![Book Cover]({{ "/assets/book_cover_600x315.png" | absolute_url }})

We are two computer scientists (K & D) who have been using cryptocurrencies for about 5 years. We've written a practical introduction for getting started with cryptocurrency. We’ve distilled all of this into 3-hour guide you can finish over a workday night.

We've written this guide because friends and family have been talking about cryptocurrencies. There is currently so much bad advice out there now playing to people's greed. We've tried to be objective and cautious.

We're very pragmatic about what people want to learn, but have put in links and explanations that shed some light on the underlying philosophies and technologies behind cryptocurrencies. We hope that these will be the long-term takeaways from this guide.

### Some Caveats

This guide is for _non-technical beginners_ and defaults to the simplest way to get things done. This often comes through some trade-off (privacy, security, fees) which we will make a note of.

We do not make any money from this guide. The text and code is [open source on Github](https://github.com/3-hour-crypto/3-hour-crypto.github.io). There are no affiliate links. If you think there are errors or improvements, please feel free to [fork and issue a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

## What we'll be doing

In 3 hours, you're going to buy your first $10 of Bitcoin, $10 of Ethereum and $10 of an Altcoin. We’ll walk you through buying this on an exchange, and then transferring it to your own desktop/offline wallet. This is the basic setup for cryptocurrencies you'll need to send and receive money in a cryptocurrency world.

### What you need

1. **$30**: This guide defaults to $10 of Bitcoin, $10 of Ethereum, and $10 of an Altcoin. Please read the [Should I "Invest"](#should-i-invest) section as to whether you should put in more.
2. **Debit/Credit Card**: We use a debit or credit card to keep this guide within 3 hours. If you don't have one, you can use a bank account or find a local seller but those will take 2-5 days.

### What you'll have after 3 hours

1. **Bitcoin/Ether Exchange**: (e.g. Coinbase) You'll be exchanging $30 here, $10 of Bitcoin and $20 of Ether. We'll learn the major concepts behind these two cryptos, and how they are different.
3. **Desktop Wallet**: This is where you'll store and keep your cryptocurrency. We'll learn about the  We'll touch on security and how to avoid losing your bitcoin.
2. **Altcoin Exchange**: (e.g. Bittrex) You'll be sending $10 of your Ether to this exchange, to buy $10 of an Altcoin. We'll learn about the wild, wild west of tokens, and the ideas they represent.

## Should I "Invest"?

`We cannot advise you on this.` There's been a lot of hype and doom around cryptocurrencies. The honest truth is that cryptocurrencies are just another societal experiment in the long arc of humanity. History is filled with examples of experiments like this. Some are wildly successful and redefine how the world works. Others pale away after the initial hype, fading into the ash heap of history.

There exists a future where Bitcoin is the world's reserve currency, and a few dominant smart contract platforms (Ethereum, Stellar, Cardano etc) power everyday business interactions. Tokens now power decentralized networks help coordinate our society efficiently.

There also exists a future where Bitcoin and privacy coins are legislated to the margins of society, and where the Ethereum and smart contracts take decades to get to the valuations they saw during the bubble of 2017/2018. Many tokens' decentralized networks failed to prove

# 1st hour: $10 of Bitcoin

We'll be learning hands-on by buying $10 of bitcoin, and then watching a few videos to understand how Bitcoin works under the hood.

## Intro (5 min)

Bitcoin was the first major decentralized digital currency, and uses cryptography to maintain a distributed ledger of transactions. The Guardian has a good introduction:

> As of Nov 2017, there are several variants of Bitcoin such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. These are different from Bitcoin. [One of the best summaries of this can be found on Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&sh=222ce783) on this subject.

## Your first Bitcoin (40 min)

This guide defaults to buying Bitcoin with a credit card (near-instantaneous) [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com/) (33 countries) or [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/) (any country) to get started quickly.

* [Coinbase](#buying-using-coinbase) is the de-facto beginner's exchange but is only available in 33 countries, and people report running into verification problems.
* [Coinmama](#buying-using-coinmama) is available in all countries and has a very loose verification process, but have a bad exchange rate and high fees. [Buysomebitcoins](https://www.buysomebitcoins.com/) is a similar alternative.

As of Dec 2017, there are many exchanges and you should research which one is best for your country for future transactions. A notable option is [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/) where you trade with local bitcoin sellers. We'll leave you to do your own research for future transactions.

# 2nd Hour: $10 of Ether

Ether is (as of Nov 2017) the second biggest cryptocurrency. Ether is the token of the Ethereum network. It allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts on its blockchain. These can be used to create decentralized applications, which can have profound and powerful impacts on how we structure organizations. Here is a good high-level introduction.
