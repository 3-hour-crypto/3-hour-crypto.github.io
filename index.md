# 3 Hour Crypto

![Book Cover]({{ "/assets/book_cover_600x315.png" | absolute_url }})

We are two computer scientists (K & D) who have been using cryptocurrencies for about 5 years. We've written a practical introduction for getting started with cryptocurrency. We’ve distilled all of this into 3-hour guide you can finish over a workday night.

We've written this guide because friends and family have been talking about cryptocurrencies. There is currently so much bad advice out there now playing to people's greed. We've tried to be objective and cautious.

We're very pragmatic about what people want to learn. However, we've put in links and explanations that shed some light on the underlying philosophies and technologies behind cryptocurrencies. We hope that these will be the long-term takeaways from this guide.

### Some Caveats

This guide is for _non-technical beginners_ and defaults to the simplest way to get things done. This often comes through some trade-off (privacy, security, fees) which we will make a note of.

We do not make any money from this guide. The text and code is [open source on Github](https://github.com/3-hour-crypto/3-hour-crypto.github.io). There are no affiliate links. If you think there are errors or improvements, please feel free to [fork and issue a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

## What we'll be doing

In 3 hours, you're going to buy your first $10 of Bitcoin, $10 of Ethereum and $10 of an Altcoin. We’ll walk you through buying this on an exchange, and then transferring it to your own desktop/offline wallet. This is the basic setup for cryptocurrencies you'll need to send and receive money in a cryptocurrency world.

### What you need

1. **$30**: This guide defaults to $10 of Bitcoin, $10 of Ethereum, and $10 of an Altcoin. Please read the [Should I "Invest"](#should-i-invest) section as to whether you should put in more.
2. **Debit/Credit Card**: We use a debit or credit card to keep this guide within 3 hours. If you don't have one, you can use a bank account or find a local seller but those will take 2-5 days.

### What you'll have after 3 hours

1. **Bitcoin/Ether Exchange**: (e.g. Coinbase) You'll be exchanging $30 here, $10 of Bitcoin and $20 of Ether. We'll learn the major concepts behind these two cryptos, and how they are different.
2. **Desktop Wallet**: This is where you'll store and keep your cryptocurrency. We'll learn about the  We'll touch on security and how to avoid losing your bitcoin.
3. **Altcoin Exchange**: (e.g. Bittrex or Binance) You'll be sending $10 of your Ether to this exchange, to buy $10 of an Altcoin. We'll learn about the wild, wild west of tokens, and the ideas they represent.
4. **Understanding the big ideas**: You'll have a high-level understanding of the technologies behind distributed ledgers, blockchains, and smart contracts.

## Should I "Invest"?

`We cannot advise you on this.` There's been a lot of hype and doom around cryptocurrencies. The honest truth is that cryptocurrencies are just another societal experiment in the long arc of humanity. History is filled with examples of experiments like this. Some are wildly successful and redefine how the world works. Others pale away after the initial hype, fading into the ash heap of history.

There exists a future where Bitcoin is the world's reserve currency, and a few dominant smart contract platforms (Ethereum, Stellar, Cardano etc) power everyday business interactions. Tokens now power decentralized networks help coordinate our society efficiently.

There also exists a future where Bitcoin and privacy coins are legislated to the margins of society, and where the Ethereum and smart contracts take decades to get to the valuations they saw during the bubble of 2017/2018. Many tokens' decentralized networks failed to prove

# 1st Hour: Bitcoin & Ether

Bitcoin was the first major decentralized digital currency, and uses cryptography to maintain a distributed ledger of transactions. The Guardian has a good introduction:

> As of Nov 2017, there are several variants of Bitcoin such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. These are different from Bitcoin. [One of the best summaries of this can be found on Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&sh=222ce783) on this subject.

### What is Bitcoin?

To buy Bitcoin (and Ether), you’ll need to use an exchange to convert your money into cryptocurrency. These exchanges will offer to exchange your fiat currency (e.g. USD) into cryptocurrency at a particular exchange rate. Most exchanges will also charge you an exchange fee (~3%) for making the exchange.

### Recommended exchanges

This guide defaults to buying Bitcoin with a credit card (near-instantaneous) [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com/) (33 countries) or [Coinmama](https://www.coinmama.com/) (any country) to get started quickly.

> As of Dec 2017, opening an exchange account on popular exchanges often takes time, and a lengthy verification process. For experimentation purposes, we can use [Coinmama](https://coinmama.com) and [Buysomebitcoins](https://www.buysomebitcoins.com/), which have little/no verification but high exchange fees

* [Coinbase](#buying-using-coinbase) is the de-facto beginner's exchange but is only available in 33 countries, and people report running into verification problems.

* [Coinmama](#buying-using-coinmama) is available in all countries and has a very loose verification process, but have a bad exchange rate and high fees. [Buysomebitcoins](https://www.buysomebitcoins.com/) is a similar alternative.

As of Dec 2017, there are many exchanges and you should research which one is best for your country for future transactions. A notable option is [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/) where you trade with local bitcoin sellers. We'll leave you to do your own research for future transactions.

## Your first Ether (30 min)

Ether is (as of Nov 2017) the second biggest cryptocurrency. Ether is the token of the Ethereum network. It allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts on its blockchain. These can be used to create decentralized applications, which can have profound and powerful impacts on how we structure organizations. Here is a good high-level introduction.

# 3rd Hour: Desktop Wallet

If you’ve completed the previous steps, the $10 of Bitcoin, $10 of Ether and $10 of Dash you bought are sitting on what is known as an exchange wallet belonging to Coinbase or Coinmama (or whatever exchange you used).

It tends to be very dangerous to leave your cryptocurrencies on an exchange. Exchanges are often prime targets for hackers (e.g. [120,000 Bitcoins being stolen from Bitfinex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfinex_hack)). Poorly-run exchanges have also gone down in the past, taking all of customers’ money with them (e.g. [Mt. Gox’s collapse in 2014](https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/)). Even a well-run exchange like Coinbase with extensive security measures is still susceptible to [phishing and impersonation attacks](http://fortune.com/2017/08/22/bitcoin-coinbase-hack/).

## Setting up Exodus (45min)

A wallet is like a mini-bank account which you are in full control of. We recommend most beginners start using a **desktop or mobile wallet**. Almost all cryptocurrencies have their own version of a desktop wallet. These wallets store your cryptocurrency’s private keys on your personal computer or mobile device. There is a small risk of loss from malware or crashes. For now, this should be sufficient for your basic cryptocurrency setup.

For this walkthrough, we’ll be guiding you to set up [Exodus](https://www.exodus.io/), a pretty, multi-currency desktop wallet that can store both Bitcoin, Ethereum and some Altcoins. As of Dec 2017, there are [many other wallet options available](https://99bitcoins.com/2017s-best-bitcoin-desktop-wallets-4-wallets-reviewed-mac-windows-linux/).

## Extra: Security Tips

We've recommended desktop wallets to start you off. Once you start holding more than $5,000, we would recommend you to explore more secure options to hold your cryptocurrency:

* **Hardware Wallets** store your cryptocurrency in a USB-stick like devices which are less exposed to malware. These typically cost money and we would recommend you get them once you hold more than ~$300 of cryptocurrency. We personally use the [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/start/ledger-nano-s).

* **Paper Wallets** are the safest way to keep your cryptocurrency but also the most complicated. We typically do not recommend this unless you have been working with cryptocurrencies for a while. You can find instructions for a [Bitcoin paper wallet](https://www.coindesk.com/information/paper-wallet-tutorial/) over here, and [Ethereum’s paper wallet](https://hackernoon.com/securely-generating-and-storing-an-ethereum-wallet-907bcbd8e5ae) here.

### Key Risks to Remember (5 min)

These are the important things to remember about your cryptocurrencies and your wallets.

* **Desktop/Mobile wallets** are vulnerable to your computer crashing/malware because the private keys are stored only on your computer.
* **Hardware wallets** are vulnerable to you losing your device, or hardware failure
* **Paper wallets** are vulnerable to you losing the piece of paper on which your private key is written. Remember, anyone who sees it can take your cryptocurrency!
